I did't finish implementing pause yet.
The movement of the stack a trying to get the min and the max are fucked

consider this initial stack A:

117
30
3
8
-1
0
5
23
10
2
-3
15
86

after pushing the max odd we might consider pushing the min odd, but that will
fuckup what we send next because we cannot sent another min odd because it cannot be on
top of the stack b in which case we have to rotate the value to keep it at the end of
stack b and bring it back again and considering that and the randomness in stack a on each
send to stack b needs to be fixed first rather that worring about stack b. after we have that
its eaasier to find a way in stack B because if we fit the pause in stack b now it will be hard
to change how we are sending shit to stack b.

we will talk more whem I arrive.
